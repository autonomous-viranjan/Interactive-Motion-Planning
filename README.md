# Interactive Motion Planning
This project aims to study the interaction between an autonomous vehicle and a human driven vehicle in urban driving.

- Real-time Software-in-the-loop simulation in CARLA with Human-in-the-loop capability.
- ROS (Noetic) for communication.

## Key dependencies:
- CARLA simulator
- Gurobi
- ROS Noetic
- MATLAB (data analysis)
